# bayesianStructuralTimeSeriesModelling

(Bayesian) structural time series model aka. state space model used for both prediction of a time series and inference of the important parameters driving the signal. This class of model decomposes the signal intro trend, systematic and noisy components. Filtering methods (such as use of kalman fitler and X11 filter) play a crucial role facilitating the decomposition of the signal into its constituents. 

Here, BSTS is used on dummy data and BSTS package used.

Many thanks to Steven Scott for such clear BSTS documentation.
